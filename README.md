# LeetCode, IOI, Codeforces Problems 

This repository combines all the problems I have solved during my journey, from entering the national team to achieving first place in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) among high school students. Hopefully, this collection will be comprehensive.

All problems are categorized by topic, and every solution is implemented in C++. Each problem has an accompanying `.md` file that includes:

- A description of the problem
- The initial approach I considered
- The actual approach that led to the solution
- Lessons learned from solving the problem
- The final C++ solution
- The complexity of the problem (Big O notation)
