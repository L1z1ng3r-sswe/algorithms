# LeetCode, IOI, Codeforces Problems 

This repository combines all the problems I have solved. Hopefully, this collection will be comprehensive.

All problems are categorized by topic, and every solution is implemented in C++ or Go. Each problem has an accompanying `.md` file that includes:

- A description of the problem
- The initial approach I considered
- The actual approach that led to the solution
- Lessons learned from solving the problem
- The final C++ solution
- The complexity of the problem (Big O notation)
